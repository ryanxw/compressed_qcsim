#
#     2. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since
#     the last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
#
#     3. If any interfaces have been added since the last public
#     release, then increment age.
#
#     4. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public
#     release, then set age to 0.
